Because the array is already sorted, you know when to stop the search. If,
for example, a[3] is bigger than the number you wanted, you can stop the 
search immediately as you know the number you are looking for will not be 
there. If, for example, a[3] is smaller, then there is a possibility that
the number you are looking for is there so the code can keep searching.
The algorithm:
It will be like the linear sort but with one more conditional statement 
stating that if the array number is bigger or equal to the number you are
looking for, the search is over.
